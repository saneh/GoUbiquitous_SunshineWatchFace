Go-Ubiquitous-Sunshine-Watch-Face
===================================

Android Wear: A custom watch face for Android Wear that uses the Sunshine weather app to display the weather along with the time.

* This watch face uses the `Wearable.MessageApi` to send and receive messages to and from the `WearableListenerService`. 
* The `WearableListenerService` then queues the `ContentProvider` for today's forecast and sends it as a msg to the wearable. The forecast is finally drawn on the watch face along with the time!
* The app synchronizes weather information from OpenWeatherMap on Android Phones and Tablets. Used in the Udacity Advanced Android course.

Getting Started
---------------
This sample uses the Gradle build system.  To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

For weather to show up, Sunshine app(included in project) must be installed before connecting phone to wearable.
You can either install the watch face and app seperately using their debug apk's or you can create a release apk which will combine both apk's into one. When you install the Sunshine release apk, the watch face should be automatically installed on the wearable once connected. If not, open the Android Wear app and select "sync apps" button.
